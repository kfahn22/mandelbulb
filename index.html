			<h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I was first exposed to the mandelbrot set a VERY long time ago when my father (a retired physics professor) became interested in coding it using postscript.
				I am not sure whether I ever saw his version, but I remember looking at the pictures in the first book published (need title).  I was fascinated with the intricate 
				designs!
				
				Fast forward many decades.  NYU professor Daniel Shiffman (The Coding Train) did a Mandelbulb coding challenge in February using Processing <a class="link" href="https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/168-mandelbulb.html">The Mandelbulb</a>. 
				By the end of the challenge, he had created a point cloud version of the mandelbulb.  He was kind enough to share his code on Discord for the couple of us that were interested 
				in tryng to render the mandelbulb.  This was the start of my journey--see below for my earliest attempts.

				At this point, I have rendered the mandelbulb using several different light techniques.  I am very please with the three color version, at least compared to my
				initial attempts.  There is still some aliasing when the colored mandelbulbs are animated, so this is something that needs improvement.

				<h2>Three Color Mandelbulb</h2>

					  Rather than the more advanced method of coloring the mandelbulb using edge detection, each of the x,y,z dimensions is assigned a different RGB color.

                    This version uses the lighting techniques of Inigo Quilez described in his Happy Jumping youtube tutorial. There is quite a bit
					of aliasing when animating, which is an avenue for future improvement. <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfe5UQ-1L9Q">Live Coding and Painting with Maths</a></a>.

                <p>
                    This is my first render of the mandelbulb in p5.js.  I started out using Jamie Wong's Shadertoy sketch
                    as a guide, which uses phong illumination <a class="link" href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llt3R4">Jamie Wong's shadertoy code</a>. 
                     I think it is pretty cool looking, but it doesn't animate well.  I suspect this is due to the raydirection
                     function, and I hope to investigate further to see if I can get this version to animate.

                <h2>Earlier Attempts</h2>
                <p>
                    I initially tried to render the mandelbulb using MeshLab. Following Dan Shiffman's lead, I loaded the vertices (all . of them)
					into MeshLab and used a guide a found in github to try to mesh the vertices.  The first version looked rather like a pin cushion because 
					the normals were facing the wrong direction!  I eventually came up with this version.  While not horrible, it is not fully rendered and it kind of looks 
					the mandelbulb is in prison.

					 <br>
                    For the next attempt, I loaded the vertices into Blender.  I was able to obtain something that looked like a very low-res version of the mandelbulb, but still 
					doesn't compare to the beauty of a nicely rendered version.

					By this point, Dan Shiffman had consulted with some colleauges and concluded that using a SDF would be a 
					better approach.  During a livestream on Twitch, he explored this possibility and provided the background 
					that I ultimately used to render the mandelbulb.  <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZIfXu_iPv4">Revisiting Mandelbulb</a></a>
