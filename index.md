## Rendering the Mandelbulb in P5.js

My journey startedmany many years ago when I was a teenager.  My father (a retired physics professor) developed an interest in the mandebrot set and  decided to code it in postscript.  I remember looking at the pictures and being fascinated by the intricate designs.  Fast forward many decades and decided to refresh my coding skills during the many months at home during the pandemic.  I started with python, R, and SQL.  I was introduced to Processing and was intrigued by the notion of procedural art work.  NYU professor Dan Shiffman wrote significant number of the examples and I eventually checked out his website and youtube tutorials.  In February, he did a mandelbulb coding challenge and wrote the code to generate the point cloud.  He also explored how to render the mandelbulb using MeshLab. He was kind enough to share share the point cloud data and his processing sketch.  I loaded the vertexes into MeshLab and made my first attempt at rendering the Mandelbulb.  In truth , it looked more like a porcupine than a mandelbulb.
