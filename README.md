# Crystal Mandelbulb

## This code uses a shader to render a static image of the mandelbulb in P5.js.  It is based on the Coding Train Mandelbulb challenge by Daniel Shiffman.  It also incorporates code written by Inigo Quilez and Jamie Wong.

## 1.  The Spherical function and mandelbulbSDF tracks as closely as possible to the code written by Daniel Shiffman. 


## 2.  Inigo Quilez  has done pioneering work on shaders and is the co-creator of shadertoy.  
### He has copywrited his mandelbulb code, and I provide the link to his shadertoy code for education purposes. 
### I have used some of his techniques in writing the mandelbulbSDF; I have tried to properly attribute those parts to him.

## 3.  The lighting and ray marching code comes from Jamie Wong.

## 4.  I also highly recommend the wonderful shader tutorials by Martijn Steinrucken

## 5.   Future Improvements 

- Try to incorporate different colors/textures
- Try to add rotation; currently, the rendered image deforms when when rotation is added.
