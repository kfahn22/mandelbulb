# Crystal Mandelbulb

## This code uses a shader to render the mandelbulb in P5.js.  It is based on the Coding Train Mandelbulb challenge by Daniel Shiffman.  It also incorporates code written by Inigo Quilez and Jamie Wong.

## 1.  The Spherical function and mandelbulbSDF track as closely as possible to the code written by Daniel Shiffman.

## 2.  Inigo Quilez  has done pioneering work on shaders and is the co-creator of shadertoy.  
### I have used some of his techniques in the .frag file;

## 3.  The lighting and ray marching code comes from Jamie Wong.

## 6.   Future Work

- Try to figure out why the mandelbulb render is so different from the "crystal" version when animation is added.
- Continue to improve efficiency and lighting.
