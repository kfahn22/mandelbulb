# Crystal Mandelbulb

## This code uses a shader to render a static image of the mandelbulb in P5.js.  It is based on the Coding Train Mandelbulb challenge by Daniel Shiffman.  It also incorporates code written by Inigo Quilez and Jamie Wong.

## 1.  The Spherical function and mandelbulbSDF track as closely as possible to the code written by Daniel Shiffman.

## 2.  Inigo Quilez  has done pioneering work on shaders and is the co-creator of shadertoy.  
### I have used some of his techniques in .frag file;

## 3.  The lighting and ray marching code comes from Jamie Wong.

## 5.   Future Improvements 

- Try to do a better job incorporating different colors/textures
- The moveable versions look pixelated and have some rendering issues when moved.
- The lighting needs to be improved, especially with the regular version.
